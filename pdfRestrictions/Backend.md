From the code you shared, your `RestrictedPdfController` is implementing page-level PDF access control with watermarking based on DSpace `ResourcePolicy` objects. Here’s a structured overview of how it works and some recommendations:

---

### **How Your Controller Works**

1. **Retrieve Bitstream**

   ```java
   Bitstream bitstream = bitstreamService.findByIdOrLegacyId(context, uuid.toString());
   ```

2. **Log Access**

   ```java
   fileAccessLogger.logAccess(context, uuid, "VIEW", request);
   ```

   * Logs every access attempt, whether successful or not.

3. **Admin Full Access**

   ```java
   if (currentUser != null && authorizeService.isAdmin(context, currentUser)) {
       // Serve full PDF with watermark
   }
   ```

4. **Policy Matching**

   * Retrieves all policies on the bitstream:

     ```java
     List<ResourcePolicy> allPolicies = resourcePolicyService.find(context, bitstream);
     ```
   * Filters policies by:

     * User-specific (`policy.getEPerson()`)
     * Group membership (including `Anonymous`)

5. **Default Full Access**

   * If no policy matches the user/group:

     ```java
     if (matchedPolicies.isEmpty()) { serve full PDF; }
     ```

6. **Page-level Filtering**

   * Collects allowed page ranges from policies:

     ```java
     List<int[]> allowedRanges;
     ```
   * Creates a new `PDDocument` and adds only the pages within allowed ranges.

7. **Watermarking**

   * `addImageWatermark(PDDocument document)`:

     * Checks `dspace.dir/watermark` for an `image.*`
     * Scales it to 40% of page width
     * Centers and applies 30% opacity

---

### **Potential Improvements / Considerations**

1. **Policy Overlaps**

   * Currently, if multiple policies allow overlapping ranges, the pages are simply added once. That’s fine, but consider logging overlaps for auditing.

2. **Empty Filtered PDFs**

   * If no page ranges match, the filtered PDF will be empty. You might want to return a 403 or a PDF with a “No access” page.

3. **Watermark Optimization**

   * Creating `PDImageXObject` for each request is fine for small PDFs, but for high-traffic, caching the watermark image in memory can improve performance.

4. **Error Handling**

   * Wrap the entire method in a try/catch to catch unexpected errors and return a proper HTTP status code.

5. **Streaming**

   * For large PDFs, consider `PDDocument.save(response.getOutputStream())` streaming with `MemoryUsageSetting` to reduce memory usage.

6. **Thread Safety**

   * Ensure `fileAccessLogger` and other services are thread-safe for concurrent requests.

7. **Anonymous Access**

   * Right now, the code treats `Anonymous` group members as allowed if a policy exists. Double-check that’s intended.

---

### ✅ **Summary**

* Your implementation correctly handles:

  * Admin full access
  * Policy-based page filtering
  * Watermark overlay
* The `PDDocument` manipulation and page filtering logic is sound.
* Small improvements can be made in performance, logging, and handling empty PDFs.

If you want, I can also **refactor `addImageWatermark` and PDF filtering** to make it **more memory-efficient and scalable**, especially for large documents with hundreds of pages. This will help if multiple users request PDFs simultaneously.
